# VS Code Workspace Settings

This folder contains workspace settings that make working with the constitution templates more convenient.

Key settings (in `settings.json`):

- `chat.promptFilesRecommendations` — recommends the prompt files in this repo to supported chat extensions so they can be surfaced to users quickly.
- `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove` — allows certain script folders (e.g., `.specify/scripts/bash/` and `.specify/scripts/powershell/`) to run in the terminal with an auto-approve setting for smooth automation.

How to use:

- Keep these settings in the workspace for consistent behavior when multiple contributors open the repository in VS Code.
- Edit or remove settings locally if you prefer different automation or prompt recommendations.

Tip: These settings are suggestions to improve developer ergonomics and can be adjusted to match team preferences.
