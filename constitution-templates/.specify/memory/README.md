# Memory Files

The `memory/` folder contains baseline constitution and memory snippets intended to seed project-specific knowledge and policies.

Files you can adapt:

- `constitution.md` — a general constitution scaffold.
- `constitution-backend.md`, `constitution-fe.md`, `constitution-monorepo.md`, `constitution-ssr.md` — focused variants for different architectures or project types.

Usage:

- Copy the file that best matches your project into your project's `.specify/memory/` and edit it to reflect your team's rules.
- Keep memory concise: include only stable facts and guiding rules rather than ephemeral details.

Tip: Use these memory files as a lightweight canonical source of project rules for automated assistants and onboarding docs.
