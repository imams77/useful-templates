# `.specify` — Templates & Memory for Project Constitutions

This folder provides templates and memory files to help define and maintain a project's constitution (guidelines, expectations, and automated memory). Copy these into your project and adapt them to your team and domain.

Usage:

- Copy the `templates/` files into your project's `.specify/templates/` and use them as a starting point when creating specs, plans, tasks, and checklists.
- Copy memory files from `memory/` into `.specify/memory/` and update the content to reflect your project's rules and history.

Structure:

- `templates/` — reusable markdown templates (specs, plans, tasks, checklists, agent files).
- `memory/` — baseline constitution and scenario-specific memory files to seed AI-driven workflows.

Best practices:

- Version your `.specify` files and track changes in PRs.
- Keep memory files concise and focused on stable facts and policies.
- Regularly review and update the constitution files as the project evolves.
